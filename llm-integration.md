## 1. Overview
- [Describe the purpose and scope of LLM integration in the Monthly Meal Plan system.]

## 2. Use Cases
- [List and describe all current and planned use cases for LLMs (e.g., recipe parsing, ingredient normalization, user query handling, etc.).]

## 3. Integration Architecture
- [Diagram and describe how the LLM is integrated with the rest of the system.]
- [Include API endpoints, data flow, and component interactions.]

## 4. Prompt Engineering
- [Document prompt templates, strategies, and examples used for LLM tasks.]
- [Include versioning and rationale for prompt changes.]

## 5. Data Flow
- [Describe the flow of data into and out of the LLM, including pre-processing and post-processing steps.]

## 6. Error Handling
- [Outline error types, fallback strategies, and user feedback mechanisms for LLM-related failures.]

## 7. Testing & Validation
- [Describe how LLM outputs are tested and validated, including automated and manual review processes.]

## 8. Security & Privacy
- [Document how user data is protected when interacting with LLMs, including data minimization, anonymization, and compliance.]

## 9. Performance Considerations
- [Discuss latency, throughput, and resource usage for LLM calls.]
- [Include any caching or batching strategies.]

## 10. Future Enhancements
- [List planned improvements, new use cases, or research areas for LLM integration.]

## 11. References
- [Cite relevant papers, documentation, or external resources.]

## 12. Research
- [Track research topics, experiments, benchmarks, and findings related to LLM integration.]
