# Shopping List Generation System

## Overview
The Shopping List Generation System automatically creates and manages purchase lists based on recipe needs versus current pantry stock. It integrates seamlessly with the pantry management system to provide intelligent shopping assistance.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Automatic List Generation
- **Recipe-Based**: Generate lists from selected recipes
- **Pantry Analysis**: Compare needed vs available ingredients  
- **Smart Aggregation**: Combine ingredients across multiple recipes
- **Store Optimization**: Organize by store sections for efficient shopping

### 2. Dynamic Updates
- **Real-time Sync**: Updates as pantry stock changes
- **Recipe Additions**: Automatically add ingredients when new recipes are selected
- **Purchase Tracking**: Mark items as bought and update pantry
- **Cost Estimation**: Track spending and budget adherence

### 3. Intelligent Optimization
- **Quantity Optimization**: LLM-powered purchase quantity suggestions
- **Substitution Alerts**: Suggest alternatives for unavailable items
- **Bulk Opportunities**: Identify cost-saving bulk purchase options
- **Seasonal Considerations**: Factor in seasonal availability and pricing

## Generation Algorithms

### Recipe Analysis Algorithm
```python
def generate_shopping_list(recipe_ids: List[str]) -> ShoppingList:
    """
    Generate shopping list from selected recipes
    
    Process:
    1. Extract all ingredients from recipes
    2. Aggregate identical ingredients
    3. Check pantry availability
    4. Calculate missing quantities
    5. Optimize purchase amounts
    6. Organize by store sections
    """
    
    ingredients = extract_ingredients(recipe_ids)
    aggregated = aggregate_ingredients(ingredients)
    availability = check_pantry_availability(aggregated)
    missing = calculate_missing_quantities(aggregated, availability)
    optimized = optimize_purchase_quantities(missing)
    organized = organize_by_store_sections(optimized)
    
    return create_shopping_list(organized)
```

### Smart Aggregation Logic
```python
def aggregate_ingredients(ingredients: List[Ingredient]) -> Dict[str, Ingredient]:
    """
    Combine same ingredients across multiple recipes
    
    Challenges:
    - Unit conversion (cups to ml, etc.)
    - Name variations ("all-purpose flour" vs "flour")
    - LLM-assisted matching for ambiguous cases
    """
    
    # Group by normalized ingredient name
    grouped = group_by_normalized_name(ingredients)
    
    # Convert to common units
    converted = convert_to_common_units(grouped)
    
    # Sum quantities
    aggregated = sum_quantities(converted)
    
    return aggregated
```

## LLM Integration

### Intelligent Ingredient Matching
```python
# Match recipe ingredients to standard pantry names
llm_prompt = """
Normalize these recipe ingredients to standard pantry item names:

Recipe ingredients:
- "1 cup all-purpose flour"
- "2 tbsp olive oil, extra virgin"  
- "1 lb ground beef (80/20)"

Standard pantry format:
- Name: [standard name]
- Quantity: [number]
- Unit: [standard unit]

Consider synonyms and common variations.
"""
```

### Purchase Optimization
```python
# LLM suggests optimal purchase quantities
llm_prompt = """
Optimize this shopping list:

Needed quantities:
{shopping_items}

Current pantry stock:
{pantry_levels}

Usage patterns:
{historical_usage}

Consider:
- Package sizes available in stores
- Shelf life and storage capacity
- Cost per unit optimization
- Frequency of use

Suggest optimal purchase quantities.
"""
```

### Store Section Organization
```python
# Organize items by store layout
llm_prompt = """
Organize these shopping items by store sections:

Items: {shopping_items}

Typical store sections:
- Produce
- Dairy
- Meat & Seafood  
- Frozen
- Pantry/Dry Goods
- Bakery
- Deli

Group items logically for efficient shopping route.
