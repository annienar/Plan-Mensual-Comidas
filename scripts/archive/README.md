# ðŸ“¦ Scripts Archive

This directory contains scripts that are no longer actively used but are preserved for historical reference.

## Archived Scripts

### `reorganize_obsolete.py`
- **Original**: `scripts/development/reorganize.py`
- **Purpose**: Directory structure reorganization for old project layout
- **Archived**: June 7, 2025
- **Reason**: Obsolete after completion of major directory consolidation
- **Notes**: Script was designed for pre-var/ directory structure and would cause issues if run on current layout

## Archive Policy

Scripts are archived when they:
1. Are no longer compatible with current project structure
2. Served a one-time purpose that is complete
3. Have been replaced by newer, better implementations
4. Would cause harm if accidentally executed

Archived scripts are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding past project structure
- Potential future adaptation if needed
