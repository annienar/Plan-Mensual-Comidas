# Migration Progress Update (as of [TODAY])

## ‚úÖ Completed
- Extraction module refactored into `core/extraction/` and `core/recipe/extractors/` with interface and class-based design.
- PDF, OCR, and TXT extractors implemented as classes, all using a common interface.
- Unit tests for extractors created and validated using real `.txt` recipes from `recetas/sin_procesar`.
- Recipe module (Phase 1):
  - Models (`Recipe`, `Ingredient`, `RecipeMetadata`) created in `core/recipe/models/`.
  - Extractors (`SectionExtractor`, `IngredientExtractor`, `MetadataExtractor`) implemented and tested.
  - Normalizers (`IngredientNormalizer`, `MeasurementNormalizer`, `TextNormalizer`) scaffolded and tested.
  - Processor (`RecipeProcessor`) orchestrator implemented and validated end-to-end with real recipes.
- All tests for text recipes pass (except for 3 known edge cases in section extraction, to be revisited).

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Step (Recommended)
- Proceed to Phase 1: Notion module migration
  - Create `core/notion/` directory and refactor Notion integration as per the migration plan.
  - Split `notion_sync.py` into `client.py`, `sync.py`, and `models.py`.
  - Add error handling and retry mechanisms.

**OR**
- Begin Phase 2: Test reorganization
  - Move and update existing tests to match the new core structure.
  - Create/organize fixtures and integration tests as outlined in the plan.

## üìù Notes
- Extraction and normalization pipeline is now modular, tested, and ready for integration.
- Edge cases in section extraction are documented and can be improved after main migration.
- All progress is tracked in this file; update after each major milestone.
